# Development Plan: Uptime Monitoring Service

## Introduction

This document outlines the phased development plan for the Uptime Monitoring Service. Each phase focuses on delivering a set of core functionalities, building incrementally towards the full feature set defined in `requirements.md`.

## Technology Stack Considerations (from requirements.md)

*   **Frontend:** Modern SPA Framework (React, Vue, or Angular)
*   **Backend API:** Node.js/Express, Python/Flask/Django, or Go/Gin
*   **Databases:**
    *   Relational: PostgreSQL or MySQL
    *   Time-Series (Recommended): InfluxDB or TimescaleDB
*   **Message Queue:** RabbitMQ, Redis Streams, or Kafka
*   **Scheduler:** Celery Beat (Python), node-cron (Node.js), Go cron library, or similar.
*   **Deployment:** Containerization (Docker, Kubernetes - optional but good for scaling)

## Development Phases

### Phase 0: Foundation & Core Infrastructure (Sprint 0-1)

**Goal:** Set up the development environment, basic project structure, and core backend components.

        *   Set up chosen relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL).
        *   Implement migrations.
    4.  **User Authentication:**
        *   Implement user registration (email/password).
        *   Implement user login and session management (e.g., JWT).
        *   Secure password storage.
    5.  **Message Queue Setup:**
        *   Choose and set up message queue (e.g., RabbitMQ).
        *   Create basic producer/consumer test.
    6.  **Scheduler - Basic Setup:**

### Phase 1: HTTP/S Monitoring & Core UI (Sprint 2-3)

**Goal:** Implement the first monitor type (HTTP/S) and a basic user interface for managing it.

*   **Tasks:**
    1.  **HTTP/S Monitoring Worker:**

    3.  **Scheduler Integration for HTTP/S:**
        *   Scheduler reads HTTP/S monitor configurations and dispatches check tasks.
    4.  **Database - Storing Check Results:**
        *   Schema for storing HTTP/S check results (monitor_id, timestamp, status, response_time, error).
        *   Decide on relational vs. initial time-series DB storage.
    5.  **Frontend - Basic UI:**
        *   Choose frontend framework.
        *   Implement login/registration pages.

        *   Display current status of monitors.
    6.  **Basic Notification (Email - Down):**
        *   Implement a basic Notification Service.
        *   Integrate an email service (e.g., SendGrid).

## Assumptions

*   This plan assumes an agile development approach with sprints (e.g., 2 weeks per sprint).
*   Team size and experience will affect the duration of each phase.
*   Priorities may shift based on feedback and business needs.

This development plan provides a roadmap. It should be treated as a living document and adjusted as the project progresses.
